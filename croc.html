  <p>Marvelous invention. Once you've let go, life brightens up.</p>
  <p>Colour is critical though. Rocking a daring pink pair right now.</p>
  <p>I'm generally in favour of function over fashion</p>
  <p>Wear mine with pride around the house -garden and</p>
  <p>would go as far as the village shop. Not much further-because they are the wrong shoe</p>
  <p>Easily found in a climbing hut, amongst the fetid, sweaty pile</p>
  <p>of otherwise identical Crocs by the door. My girlfriend pointed </p>
  <p>and laughed at my crocs then promptly requisitioned them.</p>
  <p>Rest assured, kind reader, because of the rubbery consistency of Crocs,</p>
  <p>they can simply be washed off and return to a pearly white state in no time!</p>
  <p>They’re equivalent to walking on pillows. They provide more airflow</p>
  <p>than a luxury fan. They’re a conversation starter. Crocs</p>
  <p>are a lifestyle and therefore aid you in achieving nirvana.</p>
  <p>You can hose them down. white Crocs should replace your white sneakers.</p>
  <p>The results will be utterly life changing.</p>
  <p>Nothing really compares to the Croc and sock combination.</p>
  <p>You don't need to add 'and socks'. In a school like Berkeley,</p>
  <p>where Birkenstocks and socks are such a run-of-the-mill sight,</p>
  <p>it’s absolutely necessary to shake up the social norms and shock your peers</p>
  <p>with an innovative combination on your phalanges. Crocs counter catastrophe</p>
  <p>by providing airflow on both the top and side of the foot</p>
  <p>allowing for constant circulation inside the shoe-shaped vessel, and in turn,</p>
  <p>prevent overheating. Practicality aside, Crocs are essentially a life choice</p>
  <p>and aid one in becoming a renewed and changed individual.</p>
  <p>It takes a certain degree of confidence to sport Crocs</p>
  <p>in any arena other than the shower. By diverging from the social norm,</p>
  <p>Croc-wearers show a certain sense of resilience to conformity</p>
  <p>and are always ahead of the curve regarding what’s cool, presenting</p>
  <p>themselves as true trendsetters. Making a footwear change </p>
  <p>to these infamous rubberized creatures will not only change your style </p>
  <p>but also completely rock your world </p>
  <p>and elevate you to a whole new level of alternative aesthetics. </p>
