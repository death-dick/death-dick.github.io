  <p>Marvelous invention. Once you've let go, life brightens up.</p>
  <p>Colour is critical though. Rocking a daring pink pair right now.</p>
  <p>I'm generally in favour of function over fashion</p>
  <p>Wear mine with pride around the house -garden and</p>
  <p>would go as far as the village shop. Not much further-because they are the wrong shoe</p>
  <p>Easily found in a climbing hut, amongst the fetid, sweaty pile</p>
  <p>of otherwise identical Crocs by the door. My girlfriend pointed </p>
  <p>and laughed at my crocs then promptly requisitioned them.</p>
  <p>Rest assured, kind reader, because of the rubbery consistency of Crocs,</p>
  <p>they can simply be washed off and return to a pearly white state in no time!</p>
  <p>They’re equivalent to walking on pillows. They provide more airflow</p>
  <p>than a luxury fan. They’re a conversation starter. Crocs</p>
  <p>are a lifestyle and therefore aid you in achieving nirvana.</p>
  <p>You can hose them down. white Crocs should replace your white sneakers.</p>
  <p>The results will be utterly life changing.</p>
  <p>Nothing really compares to the Croc and sock combination.</p>
  <p>You don't need to add 'and socks'. In a school like Berkeley,</p>
  <p>where Birkenstocks and socks are such a run-of-the-mill sight,</p>
  <p>it’s absolutely necessary to shake up the social norms and shock your peers</p>
  <p>with an innovative combination on your phalanges. Crocs counter catastrophe</p>
  <p>by providing airflow on both the top and side of the foot</p>
  <p>allowing for constant circulation inside the shoe-shaped vessel, and in turn,</p>
  <p>prevent overheating. Practicality aside, Crocs are essentially a life choice</p>
  <p>and aid one in becoming a renewed and changed individual.</p>
  <p>It takes a certain degree of confidence to sport Crocs</p>
  <p>in any arena other than the shower. By diverging from the social norm,</p>
  <p>Croc-wearers show a certain sense of resilience to conformity</p>
  <p>and are always ahead of the curve regarding what’s cool, presenting</p>
  <p>themselves as true trendsetters. I have flat feet and poor circulation,</p>
  <p>so I need something between my foot and the ground and also something wrapped</p>
  <p>around it to keep it warm. I like going barefoot on sandy beaches,</p>
  <p>but now my knees complain about walking in sand. I am an old. A flat-footed old.</p>
  <p>Old religious convict wearing crocs and socks? Definitely</p>
  <p>Crocs are excellent. I wear mine with pride. Black ideally,</p>
  <p>& get them dusty, new black ones look naff.</p>
  <p>Not sure if any other info would be relevant?</p>
  <p>Crocs offer an occult level of comfort to the feet</p>
  <p>whilst simultaneously marking the wearer as 'deficient' in some way.</p>
  <p>Who knew that mass-produced foamy super-slippers would become</p>
  <p>a double-reflective phenomena. A perfectly calibrated two-way psychological mirror?</p>
  <p>Nothing says 'generic, passive and gender-neutral' like a family in Crocs</p>
  <p>If I could just invoke the nostril-flaring, unquestioningly innocent</p>
  <p>and un-ironic self-regard of 70's porn-man while wearing this ensemble?</p>
  <p>If I could - I would conquer everything. Every. Thing!</p>
  <p>Crocs, trainer-socks and shorts. Crossing the lawn</p>
  <p>to the cabin. I actually stood awhile, midway, just marvelling</p>
  <p>at the effect in the dewy grass. Mist in the air. Just warm enough afoot,</p>
  <p>yet not perspiring thanks to paradisiacal comfort-levels afforded by</p>
  <p>the Crocs + socks ensemble. Stuff of dreams. The doctor smiled.</p>
  <p>“Now I'm going to show you something private and very confidential.”</p>
  <p>My eyebrows shot up as Cole scooted a stool over, then took off his crocs and socks.</p>
  <p>What is a Community?</p>
  <p>I'd written off Crocs as being like plastic clogs i.e. neither stylish nor practical</p>
  <p>I'd never worn Crocs, I felt I'm missing out on something.......</p>
  <p>"Crocs are like kryptonite to those whose self-regard hinges</p>
  <p>upon style and status. Crocs are for nurses</p>
  <p>no-one else has either need of such comfort or occupational disregard for such style suicide.</p>
  <p>Crocs are for children and/or clown-persons</p>
  <p>Nothing says 'I'm alone' like a man in Crocs Nothing says </p>
  <p>'Married with kids' like a man in Crocs... people who wear Crocs </p>
  <p>are the perennial low-hanging piñatas upon which self-styled style gurus may whack themselves </p>
  <p>into a scoffing, self-righteous snorting lather. I dont care who wears them </p>
  <p>crocs are ridiculous and should be melted down and turned into marital aids.</p>
  <p>Crocs can be bad for the feet if worn frequently/long enough I've read.</p>
  <p>The holy trinity, socks, Crocs, and ankle monitor.</p>
  <p>Let me guess. Florida.</p>
  <p>Yes, Crocs sales have been dropping and, coincidentally, so has their stock price.</p>
  <p>The creator, and sole investor, responsible for bringing the world the Croc</p>
  <p>is probably not too pressed, though, as this was only meant to be a fad. Said fad</p>
  <p>has run way too long in my book though, and I’d like to position myself, here and now,</p>
  <p>defiantly on the frontline, taking shots at this plastic-resin based article of footwear.</p>
  <p>Haha! Yes, cut them. Cut them apart. Cut people wearing them, </p>
  <p>cut their feet whilst a'wearing. I wear flip flops regularly </p>
  <p>because I don't like shoes, but I draw the line at toe shoes or the worst of all, Crocs.</p>
  <p>When I'm king the first things to go are the Croc factory and the Ugg factory. </p>
  <p>Such blatant disregard for aesthetics that they're offensive. Crocs --</p>
  <p>For people who really don't give a shit what others think."</p>
  <p>I found them cheap in tkmaxx and they are surprisingly comfortable.</p>
  <p>Damn, you see, I like my crocs because they are supportive yet really light. </p>
  <p>But I freely admit they are unsightly and I don't wear them out of the house </p>
  <p>(unless I'm walking the dog). The socks bit is the winter modification.</p>
  <p>my friend David said that I never noticed he was wearing crocs and socks But he comes home, </p>
  <p>and it's full-on. He's still wearing them, sometimes. And then if he ever varies from it, </p>
  <p>it will be equally as bad. He'll have on a full-on sweatsuit, and then his Crocs with socks</p>
  <p>Would those down filled tent slippers be a more acceptable alternative?</p>
  <p>I think it's all about pool sliders this year</p>
  <p>'Crocs with socks' is surely the 'black hole' of style? I wore them yesterday morning</p>
  <p>Erika looked down and cringed. Crocs and socks, there was no saving this man's soul.... </p>
  <p>"What do I have to do? What will make you happy?" he moaned dramatically. </p>
  <p>This had been going on for weeks the rubber clogs that started out in 2002 </p>
  <p>as boater-floaters for Jimmy Buffett types in Florida Great protection for toes </p>
  <p>and great to lounge around. Also great for travel in tropics with aquatic activities<p>
  <p>"They are great at the dog park or in the backyard </p>
  <p>where I am likely to step in something that is very difficult to clean off </p>
  <p>sneakers but comes off easily with a hose or a wipe from my clogs,' </p>
  <p>one wearer writes in an Amazon review. under no circumstances </p>
  <p>can I suggest wearing Crocs 8 to 10 hours per day. Making a footwear change </p>
  <p>to these infamous rubberized creatures will not only change your style </p>
  <p>but also completely rock your world </p>
  <p>and elevate you to a whole new level of alternative aesthetics. </p>
