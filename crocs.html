  <p>Marvelous invention. Once you've let go, life brightens up.</p>
  <p>Colour is critical though. Rocking a daring pink pair right now.</p>
  <p>I'm generally in favour of function over fashion</p>
  <p>Wear mine with pride around the house -garden and</p>
  <p>would go as far as the village shop. Not much further-because they are the wrong shoe</p>
  <p>Easily found in a climbing hut, amongst the fetid, sweaty pile</p>
  <p>of otherwise identical Crocs by the door. My girlfriend pointed </p>
  <p>and laughed at my crocs then promptly requisitioned them.</p>
